# 🧠 Python Projects and DSA Practice

Welcome to my personal collection of Python-based projects and problem-solving exercises! This repository is a reflection of my learning journey in programming, software development, and algorithmic thinking using Python — one of the most powerful and beginner-friendly languages.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repository is organized into directories, each representing individual projects or topics of interest. The contents range from small utility programs to concept-driven applications and exploratory experiments. Every folder contains code, documentation (if applicable), and notes to help understand the thought process behind the implementations.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Varies by project – includes standard modules and third-party libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `random`, `plotly`, etc.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, command-line scripts

## 📚 DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

A significant section of this repository is dedicated to DSA — a fundamental area for anyone aiming to strengthen their problem-solving skills or prepare for technical interviews.

### What You'll Find:
- **Core Data Structures:** Arrays
- **Algorithmic Techniques:** Sorting, Searching,
- **Explanations:** Well-commented code, and complexity analysis (where applicable)

The goal is not just to solve problems but to understand the *why* and *how* behind each solution.
