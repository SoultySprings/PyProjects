    print('''The rules are simply that:
    1. You deal a number
    2. The dealer then deals a number
    3. Based on that and the number that you have, you have 2 choices
    4. You either Hit, to get a larger number but below 21, or
    5. You either Stay, to have the same number and let the Dealer Hit
    6. If the number goes above 21 for you, you lose
    7. If after staying, the dealer deals a higher number you lose,
    8. If after hitting or staying, ur number is higher than then the dealer but below 21, you win!
    
    Shall we start the game?''')
